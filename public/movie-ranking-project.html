<h1>The Best Movies According to Laura</h1>
<h2>These are some of my all-time favourites</h2>

<h3>Emma (2020)</h3>
<p>Every aspect of this movie is pretty much perfect in my book. The music, the costuming, the set design, the writing, the direction and the acting (the casting choice are perfect) all play into a trully marvelous adaptatation of one of Jane Austen's wittiest works. It really is such a good adaptation of Austen as it captures the comedy of her writing and ability to write the most deliciously annoying characters. As a fan of historical fashion I like that the costuming at first glance isn't your typical regency drama costuming but it's clear that inspiration was taken from actual style cards from the regency period, clearly a great deal of research and thought went into creating looks that were historically accurate yet colouful and refreshing at the same time. This movie is truly a testiment to Autumn De Wilde's directing talent and an underated feat of modern cinema.</p>

<h3>Confessions of a Shopaholic</h3>
<p>This is my list ok, if your looking for objectivity you won't find it here. Anyway, this is my no.1 comfort movie. I was mesmerised by it as a kid, now as an adult I find myself relating more and more to the protagonist. Some say this movie is only enjoyable if you yourself have shopaholic tendencies and to be fair I do so that may be why I enjoy it so much. The movie is silly yet charming wee romcom about a Finance guy and a girl with a shopping addiction and I love every minute of it.</p>

<h3>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</h3>
<p>This is just a really fun movie with Michael Cera in it.</p>
